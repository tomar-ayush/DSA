1. Basics of Rotated Arrays

    Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the maximum element in a rotated sorted array.
    Search for an element in a rotated sorted array (with and without duplicates).
    Check if an array is a rotated sorted array.

2. Binary Search Variations

    Find the index of rotation (pivot index) in a rotated sorted array.
    Count the number of rotations in a rotated sorted array.
    Search for an element in a rotated sorted array with duplicates.

3. Advanced Searching in Rotated Arrays

    Find the first and last occurrences of a target in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the smallest missing number in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the peak element in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the next greater element for every element in a rotated sorted array.

4. Handling Duplicates

    Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array with duplicates.
    Search for an element in a rotated sorted array with duplicates (consider edge cases).

5. Subarray/Range-Based Questions

    Find the sum of elements in a given range in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the longest increasing subarray in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the maximum sum of a subarray in a rotated sorted array.

6. Rotation and Modification

    Rotate an array by k positions (both left and right rotations).
    Check if two arrays are rotations of each other.
    Reverse a rotated array back to its original sorted form.
    Find the rotation point in a rotated sorted array (using binary search).

7. Real-World Applications

    Find the closest pair of numbers to a given target in a rotated sorted array.
    Find the number of pairs with a given sum in a rotated sorted array.
    Search for a range of elements (e.g., [low, high]) in a rotated sorted array.

8. Edge Cases

    Handle edge cases like arrays with a single element or all identical elements.
    Handle scenarios where the array is not rotated (already sorted).
    Work with empty arrays and invalid inputs.

9. Combination with Other Concepts

    Find the intersection of two rotated sorted arrays.
    Merge two rotated sorted arrays.
    Search for an element in a rotated matrix (2D array).
    Find the minimum in a k-rotated sorted array combined with binary search.
