# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my coding chaos! This repo is my playground for tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as I prep for interviews. Here, you’ll find problems, my sometimes questionable solutions, and personal notes filled with “aha!” moments and facepalms. Join me on this journey to enhance my skills and prepare effectively for upcoming technical challenges.
