## Corner Cases

When tackling sequence problems, consider the following corner cases:

- **Empty Sequence**: Handle scenarios with no elements.
- **Sequence with 1 or 2 Elements**: Ensure edge cases with minimal elements are managed.
- **Sequence with Repeated Elements**: Address issues arising from duplicates.
- **Duplicated Values in the Sequence**: Identify and manage multiple occurrences effectively.

## Techniques

### Sliding Window

The sliding window technique is essential for many subarray/substring problems. It involves two pointers moving in the same direction without overtaking each other, ensuring each value is visited at most twice, achieving a time complexity of O(n). 

**Examples**:
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum
- Minimum Window Substring

### Two Pointers

The two pointers technique is a generalization of sliding window, where pointers can cross and operate on different arrays. 

**Examples**:
- Sort Colors
- Palindromic Substrings
- Merge Sorted Array

### Traversing from the Right

In certain scenarios, traversing the array from the right can yield more efficient solutions.

**Examples**:
- Daily Temperatures
- Number of Visible People in a Queue

### Sorting the Array

Assess whether the array is sorted or partially sorted, as this may enable the use of binary search, leading to faster solutions than O(n).

**Examples**:
- Merge Intervals
- Non-overlapping Intervals

### Precomputation

For problems involving summation or multiplication of subarrays, consider using precomputation techniques like hashing or prefix/suffix sums.

**Examples**:
- Product of Array Except Self
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum

### Index as a Hash Key

When working with a sequence and O(1) space is required, the array itself can often function as a hash table, especially if the values are within a specific range.

**Examples**:
- First Missing Positive
- Daily Temperatures

### Traversing the Array More Than Once

While it may seem inefficient, traversing the array multiple times (but fewer than n) can still maintain O(n) complexity and help solve the problem.

## Essential Questions

These fundamental questions are crucial for mastering sequence problems:

- Two Sum
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Product of Array Except Self
- Maximum Subarray

## Recommended Practice Questions

After familiarizing yourself with the techniques and essential questions, practice the following recommended questions:

- Contains Duplicate
- Maximum Product Subarray
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- 3Sum
- Container With Most Water
- Sliding Window Maximum
